This is my webpage, which I use to display a brief information about myself.

I am using Nuxt + Vue because it looks a pretty straightfoward option to me. As
a person that don't do frontend very often, it is actually very simple to
understand and build a SSR site with almost zero boilerplate code.

If you find anything that could be improved, fell free to contribute! (but keep it minimal :blush:)

## `TODO`:
- [x] Scaffold
- [x] Add some minimalist CSS lib
- [x] Add my Github activity
- [ ] Support other events in my Github activity
- [ ] Tests!
- [ ] Add languages I'm currently working with (get it automatically from wakatime? :thinking:)
- [ ] Add social media links
