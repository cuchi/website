This is my webpage, which I use to display a brief information about myself.

I am using Nuxt + Vue because it looks a pretty straightfoward option to me. As
a person that don't do frontend very often, it is actually very simple to
understand and build a SSR site with almost zero boilerplate code.

If you find anything that could be improved, fell free to contribute!
